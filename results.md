Switzerland/Mexico

1. Path Tracing
Identify a random subset of at least 20 government-related resources from each country, selecting an even mix of domestically and internationally hosted content.
Use traceroute (or equivalent tools) to map the paths between a vantage point in each country and the servers hosting these websites.

2. Geolocation Analysis
Geolocate the IP addresses in the paths, determining the physical locations of the servers and identifying any cross-border dependencies.

3. Justification
Provide a rationale for your choice of countries and websites, explaining how they illustrate contrasting trends in government hosting. Reference findings from Kumar et al. to support your choices.

4. Documentation
Present your findings in a report that includes:
A summary of the two countriesâ€™ hosting profiles based on Kumar et al.
Visualizations of the traced paths (e.g., network graphs or maps).
An analysis of cross-border dependencies and how they relate to the countries' hosting strategies.
Reflections on the measurement challenges encountered.
